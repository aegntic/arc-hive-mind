Archivemind is **free, open, and hackable.** Run it, fork it, and share it — no strings attached — except one: **don’t sell it as‑a‑service without talking to us first.**

---

### 1  You Can

* Offer Archivemind (original or modified) as a hosted or managed service that others can sign up for.
* Bundle Archivemind into another paid product.

> **Consulting/support is totally fine.** Get paid to install, customise, or teach Archivemind as long as your clients don’t get a hosted Archivemind instance run by you.
